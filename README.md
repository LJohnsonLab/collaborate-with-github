# 🧬 Git & GitHub for Bioinformatics Projects

This repository provides a practical guide to using **Git** and **GitHub** for managing code, data analysis workflows, and collaborative projects in a bioinformatics research environment.

## 🛠️ What is Git?

Git is a version control system that tracks changes in files over time. It allows researchers to:

- 📜 Keep a detailed history of code and analysis scripts  
- 🔄 Revert to previous versions when errors occur  
- 🌿 Work in parallel using branches without interfering with each other's work  

---

## ☁️ What is GitHub?

GitHub is a cloud-based platform that hosts Git repositories and provides tools for collaboration. It enables:

- 📤 Sharing code and data analysis pipelines  
- 👥 Coordinating contributions from multiple lab members  
- ✅ Reviewing and merging changes through pull requests  
- 📌 Managing issues, documentation, and project milestones

## 🔍 Why Use Git and GitHub in `LJohnsonLab`?

Bioinformatics projects often involve complex scripts, evolving pipelines, and multi-person teams. Git and GitHub help ensure:

- 🧪 **Reproducibility**: All code changes are documented and traceable  
- 🤝 **Collaboration**: Multiple team members can contribute safely  
- 📢 **Transparency**: Improves scientific communication with clear, versioned workflows  
- ⚙️ **Automation**: Integrates with continuous analysis tools like Nextflow or Snakemake
